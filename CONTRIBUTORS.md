## Contributing to DGL

Contribution is always welcomed. A good starting place is the roadmap issue, where
you can find our current milestones. All contributions must go through pull requests
and be reviewed by the committers. See our [contribution
guide](https://docs.dgl.ai/contribute.html) for more details.

Once your contribution is accepted and merged, congratulations, you are now a
contributor to the DGL project.  We will put your name in the list below.
