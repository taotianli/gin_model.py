  This model belongs to the family that deals with structural
  generation. Deep generative models of graphs (DGMG) uses a state-machine approach. 
  It is also very challenging because, unlike Tree-LSTM, every
  sample has a dynamic, probability-driven structure that is not available
  before training. You can progressively leverage intra- and
  inter-graph parallelism to steadily improve the performance.
