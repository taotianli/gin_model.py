class EdgeConv(nn.Module):
    r"""EdgeConv layer from `Dynamic Graph CNN for Learning on Point Clouds
    <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07829>`__

    It can be described as follows:

    .. math::
       h_i^{(l+1)} = \max_{j \in \mathcal{N}(i)} (
       \Theta \cdot (h_j^{(l)} - h_i^{(l)}) + \Phi \cdot h_i^{(l)})

    where :math:`\mathcal{N}(i)` is the neighbor of :math:`i`.
    :math:`\Theta` and :math:`\Phi` are linear layers.

    .. note::

       The original formulation includes a ReLU inside the maximum operator.
       This is equivalent to first applying a maximum operator then applying
       the ReLU.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_feat : int
        Input feature size; i.e, the number of dimensions of :math:`h_j^{(l)}`.
    out_feat : int
        Output feature size; i.e., the number of dimensions of :math:`h_i^{(l+1)}`.
    batch_norm : bool
        Whether to include batch normalization on messages. Default: ``False``.
    allow_zero_in_degree : bool, optional
        If there are 0-in-degree nodes in the graph, output for those nodes will be invalid
        since no message will be passed to those nodes. This is harmful for some applications
        causing silent performance regression. This module will raise a DGLError if it detects
        0-in-degree nodes in input graph. By setting ``True``, it will suppress the check
        and let the users handle it by themselves. Default: ``False``.

    Note
    ----
    Zero in-degree nodes will lead to invalid output value. This is because no message
    will be passed to those nodes, the aggregation function will be appied on empty input.
    A common practice to avoid this is to add a self-loop for each node in the graph if
    it is homogeneous, which can be achieved by:

    >>> g = ... # a DGLGraph
    >>> g = dgl.add_self_loop(g)

    Calling ``add_self_loop`` will not work for some graphs, for example, heterogeneous graph
    since the edge type can not be decided for self_loop edges. Set ``allow_zero_in_degree``
    to ``True`` for those cases to unblock the code and handle zero-in-degree nodes manually.
    A common practise to handle this is to filter out the nodes with zero-in-degree when use
    after conv.

    Examples

    >>> g = dgl.add_self_loop(g)
    >>> feat = th.ones(6, 10)
    >>> conv = EdgeConv(10, 2)
    >>> res = conv(g, feat)

    >>> # Case 2: Unidirectional bipartite graph
    >>> u = [0, 1, 0, 0, 1]
    >>> v = [0, 1, 2, 3, 2]
    >>> g = dgl.bipartite((u, v))
    >>> u_fea = th.rand(2, 5)
    >>> v_fea = th.rand(4, 5)

            The graph.

                # (2) Even if the point clouds always have the same number of
                #     points, the points may as well be shuffled even with the
                #     same (type of) object (and the official implementation
